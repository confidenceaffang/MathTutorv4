Program: MathTutor

  Description: This program is intended to be a math tutor design for a younger
  audience. As of V3, It'll generate two random numbers between a set range that is
  determined by the current level that the user is at (i.e A # with a max of 10 to a
  number with a max of 20), using the system clock as the seed, generate a random
  operator, do the math with both the random numbers and the operator to produce a
  correct answer. After this, the program displays an intro screen with a title, and
  some "Facts", after this, the program gets the user's full name via getline, and
  then introduce the player to the program. Afterward, the program uses the previously
  generated numbers to provide a question for the user to answer, afterward, the
  program will compare the user's input to the result of the machine answered question.
  Also included is error handling in the event that the program generates an impossible
  math operator, as well as if the user enters a non-integer response to a question.
  This program, over the course of the user answering questions, will increase or
  decrease to a different "Level" based on the amount of questions the
  user gets right/wrong. The user get 3 attemps at every question, and if they fail
  3 different questions, they level down. This also applies vice versa.
